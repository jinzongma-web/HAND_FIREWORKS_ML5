# HAND_FIREWORKS_ML5
This project uses ml5.js and p5.js to create an interactive fireworks effect based on hand gesture recognition. When the user opens their fingers, colorful fireworks are generated on the screen in real time.

### After saving the files, open the project in VS Code. In the top search bar, search for Live Server and install it.
